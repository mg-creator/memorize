Sample app that shows Kotlin + Android capabilities

## Application

This application basically shows basic stuff that we can do with Kotlin in Android Studio.

### Requirements

* Android Studio with Kotlin extension
* Machine with virtualization enabled and compatible with Google's emulator

### Sections

This application is based on two _activities_: login and main activity. The main activity
uses a bunch of different _fragments_ that we do use to show what can be done with Android's
SDK.

The structure would be the following:

* Login
* Main
  * Calculator
  * Game
  * Statistics
    * Local
    * Global
  * Map
